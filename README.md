# DR-HQ-Assets
The goal is to eventually have higher quality/vector versions of the images in Dungeon Rampage. The game zooms in on objects, making the .pngs look low quality. Vectors don't have this problem.
The purpose of this repo is to keep track of the assets that have already been upscaled or vectored, and those that still need done for the high quality textures mod
